Now days I'm usually studying about Java and solving algorithm questions. 
This pages are daily java study codes reporsitory.

If you want to watch my code about algorithm, please visit my [blog page](https://readydeveloperone.blogspot.com/).

Oops, this blog page is written by **Korean**, because, I couldn't explain fluently in English(jargon or something like that you know). So please understand about it, thanks.
