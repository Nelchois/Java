# Hi, this is Nelchois.
Now days I'm usually studying about Java and solving algorithm questions. 
Here is my daily java study codes page, and if you want to watch my code about algorithm, please come to my [blog page](https://readydeveloperone.blogspot.com/). Oops, this blog page is written by **Korean**, because, I couldn't explain fluently in English(jargon or something like that you know). So please understand about it, thanks.
